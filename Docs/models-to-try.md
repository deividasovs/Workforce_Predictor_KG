A model is said to be skillful if it provides better accuracy than a simpler baseline forecast model — If the mean absolute percentage error in our exercise — is worse than what the baseline model achieves, the more complex model would be deemed useless. Exponential smoothing is another baseline forecasting technique

^^ Could be worth going through that tutorial


GluonTS - Deep learning for TimeSeries forecasting
https://ts.gluon.ai/stable/


Time Series used to predict count of staff needed for a certain hour, then allocated with constraint programming.   


# Time Series Algorithms to try
Main:   
- ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)
- DeepAR+
- Temporal Fusion Transformer
- ETS
- LSTM   

Other possibles
- CNN-QR
- Prophet
- NPTS

# Non-Timeseries -> Staff allocation
- Constraint Programming
- Particle Swarm Optimization - For allocating shifts into table
- Evolutionary Algorithms
- Ant Conoly Optimization
